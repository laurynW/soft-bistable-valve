# Soft bistable valve
A soft bistable valve is a device that has a membrane that opens or closes tubing depending on the way the membrane is flipped; acting analogously to a MOSFET transistor in an electrical circuit. The soft bistable valve can be configured as either an OR-gate, an AND-gate, or a NOT-gate.

### Materials 
* Vacuum-chamber
* DragonSkin 10 NV
* Smooth-On Smooth-Sil™
* Gorilla glue
* Mold Release Spray
* Gloves 
* Scale 
* Pot
* Paper towels
* Wooden dowel 
* Pigment
* Molds (4 pieces)
* Needles (4)
* Acrylic sheets (6)

### Setting up

1. First gather all the materials on the list above.
2. Put on a set of gloves, open the vacuum chamber and connect it to a power supply. 
3. Place the bottom of the vacuum chamber with a paper towel to avoid creating a mess when the chamber is used in future steps. 
4. Before moving on to preparing the mixture, turn the scale on, place the pot on the scale, and zero the scale.
5. The molds need to be fabricated before the fabrication process starts. Below are the snippets of the molds; detailed information can be gained from the supplemental materials.

### Fabrication of body for soft bistable valve

#### Preparing the mixture
1. Take any elastomer (e.g., DragonSkin 10NV) and read the datasheet for the pot life, cure time, and the ratio the materials are poured in; for DragonSkin 10NV the pot life is 15 minutes, the cure time is 75 minutes, and they should be poured in a 1:1 ratio (same weight for each substance). 
2. If this is a new set of DragonSkin, make two holes in the tops of each of the containers: one large hole for pouring and one smaller hole to allow airflow. Then follow these ensuing steps:


     * Pour ~30g of material 1 into the cup on the scale. Record the exact weight of material 1, zero the scale, take a new paper towel to clean the rim of the container.
     * Repeat step 1 for material 2, trying to match the weight of material 2 to the exact weight of material 1. Start the timer of the pot life (15 minutes) as the chemical reactions have started. Clean the rim of the container with material 2 with a new paper towel to mitigate the risk of curing the lids shut.
     * Take the pot off the weighing machine and add pigment (~1 g) by dipping a wooden dowel slightly in the pigment. Then using that dowel slowly mix the mixture to avoid introducing air bubbles.
     * Place the pot with the mixture on top of the cloth inside the vacuum chamber and close it with a lid of the vacuum chamber.
     * Turn on the vacuum chamber using the correct valve orientation. Once started you will be able to see a rise of pressure on the gauge. 
     * Keep track of time and air bubble reduction in the mixture. While the vacuum chamber is running, start preparing the molds.
 
#### Preparing the mixture 

* Create a designated area where the molds can cure; they will be difficult to move once they are filled with a solution. 
* Apply the mold release spray from ~30 cm away from the mold to thoroughly coat it. Do this for all molds and needles. 
* Now assemble the cap molds by putting the needles into the holes of the top and bottom, leaving a small gap between the needles by resting them on the pegs in the mold. 
* To keep needles in place, place an acrylic sheet (one per needle) on the ends.
* When there are a few bubbles on the perimeter of the pot in the vacuum chamber, switch off the pump to release air from the vacuum chamber, otherwise it could implode.

#### Pouring into the molds
* To fill the first mold of the valve, take the pot and pour in the substance at a 45° angle and rotate the mold while pouring so that material gets into all the crevices and closes effectively.
* Pour to the top of the mold (do not worry about excess material, for it will get forced out in the following step).
* For the top and bottom cap molds (with the needles), first only pour on one side of the needles. Wait for the material to settle and flow from underneath the needle. Then pour from the other side to fill in the rest of the molds. The needles should be covered.
* Returning to the first mold, coat the lid of the valve mold by slowly turning it at an 80° angle to the valve mold as shown in Figure 3D. Once the lid is nicely coated, rotate and push the cap on snuggly. Excess material will come out of the top hole.
* Returning to the cap molds, slowly lower an acrylic sheet (one for each cap mold) at a ~20° angle and push down.
* Set the timer for curing. After done curing, carefully remove the molds and other supporting fixtures.

More detailed information can be found in the linked supplemental files. 

### Fabrication of tubing for soft bistable valve
* For tubing, use Smooth-On Smooth-Sil™ and follow the same step from mixing the mixture and pouring the material into the mold. 
* Seal the tubing to the chamber and tips with gorilla glue and keep it for 30 mins to get it dried out.

### Assembly of the body and tubing 
* Glue tubing and body together to form the bistable valve.
* The device is ready for testing.
* The allowed maximum pressure for operating the soft bistable valve is 30 kPa. A pneumatic pump can be used to provide a positive pressure supply. 

## Important Physical Considerations for soft bistable valve
1. Propagation delay: The propagation delay is dependent on the membrane thickness, opening angle of the membrane, material properties of the membrane, as well as the chamber volume and length of tubes between valves.
2. In a fluidic circuit where the number of soft bistable valves are connected to each other, as the number of soft bistable valves increases, the propagation delay also increases.

More detailed information can be found in the linked supplemental files.
